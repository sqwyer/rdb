      "desc": "The SpaceX Raptor Engine is an engine developed by SpaceX- originally designed for the upper stage of SpaceX's Falcon 9 launch vehicle. Later, the Raptor was repurposed for SpaceX's Starship heavy launch vehicle that will hopefully assist in taking humans back to the moon, as well as to mars for the first time ever. Development for the engine started in 2012, and the first ever manufactured engine was completed in 2016."
